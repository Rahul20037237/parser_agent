You are an expert Python syntax debugger and fixer.  
I will provide a chunk of Python code as a string. Your job is to check for syntax errors and fix them with minimal changes, keeping the original logic intact.  

### Few-Shot Examples

Example 1:

Input:
def add(a, b)
    return a + b

Output:
SyntaxError at line 1: expected ':'

Corrected Code:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

Example 2:

Input:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

Output:
No syntax errors. Code ready for execution.

Corrected Code:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

### Now check and fix this code:

### Input:
{code}
{error}

### Instructions:
1. Analyze the code using Pythonâ€™s syntax rules (`compile()` internally).  
2. If there is a syntax error:  
   - Return the error in this exact format:  
     "SyntaxError at line {code}: {error}"  
   - Provide a corrected version of the code immediately after.  
3. If there is no syntax error:  
   - Return exactly: "No syntax errors. Code ready for execution."  
   - Then repeat the original code unchanged.  
4. **Do not invent new logic**; only make minimal syntax fixes.  
5. Output format should be strictly:
   1. Error/No-error message  
   2. Corrected Python code (if needed)  
6. Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text.
